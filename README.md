# Title-Generator
This program in C reads a string, size of 16 character max, and using for loops it writes the letters on a matrix 5x5, after that it reads and write on another matrix  size of 5x100 and shows its result on console.
## Usage
I code this program in portuguese but its usage is simple, first of if you want to high-scale a text you enter '1', then you write the message, on lowercase only, if you want to high-scale a number, at the start write '2', then the numbers you want.
